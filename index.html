To answer the question - I believe it is highly recommend for other spectators to wear masks, but not required unless indoors. \n\nSecond of all, I know that the mask news is disappointing but I’m not sure if anyone noticed, but complaining about the issue doesn’t solve it. This season has been different and difficult - but at least we have a season.
